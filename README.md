# React Cats Exercise

This is an exercise for practicing React. We will focus mainly in fetching from apis and handle states.

The goal is to get a random fact from this API: https://catfact.ninja/fact and then use the first three words to fetch a
picture from this API: https://cataas.com

You can't use a template to create the React's project, so at the beginning you need to select Vanilla JavaScript when
initialize the project with Vite. You can't use an external library to fetch like axios.

You can style the app as you wish.
